# SECURE ERP

**Team project:**  2 programmers \* 4 work days >> 8 Man-Days

**Technology/Language used:** 100% Python, Console I/O



**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** is the integrated management of main business processes, often in real time and mediated by software and technology.
Keep track of customers, transactions and employees.
The data is kept in CSV files [client request].



## Client [school] requirements:

* The client want to see a solution that is *super secure*: a short and clean codebase that works on local files, strictly on offline computers. 

* They require a highly modularized structure

* Create a variant of the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture for terminal and local data files.

* Do not spend much time on input checking. This time it is not a problem if a badly formatted data breaks your code.
